  working_directory: '/test/dir'
})

// All event types logged successfully
await logger.logEvent(toolExecutionEvent)
await logger.logEvent(aiRequestEvent)
const summary = await logger.endSession(sessionId, {...})

// âœ… VERIFIED OUTPUT:
// 1. âœ… .opencode-trace/sessions/[timestamp]_session-[id].jsonl exists

### âœ… Test Fixes Successfully Applied

#### Test 5 - Data Sanitization System (FIXED)
**Solution**: Added `isSensitiveFieldName()` method to detect sensitive property names
**Result**:
```
Original data: {"apiKey":"sk-1234567890abcdef","password":"secret123","normalData":"this is fine","token":"bearer_token_12345"}
Sanitized result: {"apiKey":"[REDACTED]","password":"[REDACTED]","normalData":"this is fine","token":"[REDACTED]"}
Was sanitized: true
Sanitized fields: ['apiKey (sensitive field)', 'password (sensitive field)', 'token (sensitive field)']
```

#### Test 6 - Performance Monitoring (FIXED)
**Solution**: Refactored to two-phase calculation eliminating circular dependency
- Phase 1: `calculateBaseMetrics()` computes metrics without recursion
- Phase 2: `calculateSystemImpact()` and `calculateDegradation()` use passed metrics
**Result**: All performance monitoring working correctly, no stack overflow
